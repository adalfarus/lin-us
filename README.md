 An open-source, user-focused distribution of Linux, that aims to be profitable. It's pronounced as /ˈlɪn.ʌs/ so as the name Lin and us.

## How to Be Provitable
To attract users transitioning from Windows 10/11, we need to offer a compelling product that users are willing to pay for, while keeping the base OS open-source. Leveraging recent privacy concerns and adopting a model similar to Google's Android, we can achieve this balance.

### Monetization Strategies:
- **Base OS**: The core operating system will remain open-source.
- **Premium Features**: Essential features for a non-Linux wizard will be monetized. This includes:
  - **Update Servers**: Access to update servers will be a paid feature.
  - **Security Updates**: Automatic and rapid updates for exploits and hacks will be offered as a premium service.
- **App Store**: Develop and monetize an App Store:
  - **Commission**: Take a 5% commission on purchased apps and 20% on in-app purchases to discourage "free" apps with excessive in-app purchases.
  - **Publishing Fees**: Charge a flat fee for publishing and updating non-open-source apps, with additional fees based on app size and download priority. Apps under 1 GB enjoy free priority.
- **Sponsored Recommendations**: Sell spots for recommended apps in updates, ensuring that only genuinely recommended apps are featured.
- **Advertising and Sponsorship**: Preinstall apps to ensure a smooth installation-to-usage experience. Technical Youtube Channels like LTT will most probably pick this up if it gets big and recommend it if it's good, given the current interest in Windows-like Linux distributions.

## How to Be User-Friendly
To facilitate user adaptation:

- **Terminal**: If a Windows-only Command is entered, recommend the linux equivalent instead. Make any "cool" Linux commands like deleting the os impossible to run.
- **OS**: Adopt a system similar to Windows with a SU that the user can't control and then a default admin and user.
- **Shortcuts**: Translate all Windows productivity shortcuts.
- **Powertoys**: Offer similar tools like PowerToys but not from the start.
- **Highly customizable**: Make it highly customizable for advanced users but also really simple for normal people.

## Notice
I started wanting this after my 5th Ubuntu VM install went up in flames. It just isn't feasible to assume that the average windows user can figure some of this stuff out.

My attempts: 
- 1-3 Ubuntu update manager throws errors and doesn't install needed utilities.
- 4 trying to install the newest version of python and uninstalling every package instead.
- 5 XOrg just stopped working.

I know that my level is not nearly enough to be making something like this but I wanted to write down my vision until I have the time and knowledge to actually do it.

If you are interested and want to, you can of course help. I currently consider Ubuntu LTS and Debian to be the best base distro, due to their extensive documentation and stability.
